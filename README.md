# Welcome!

We are glad that you found your way here. Assumably, you come from our chapter "A Modern God Complex - Doctor Who?" from the collaborative book "AI in public discourse" that is
the result of a seminar with the same name and that was conducted by Dr. phil. Tobias Thelen at the University of Osnabr√ºck in winter semester 20/21.

## What to find where?
Under "CATMA_results.csv" and "CATMA_results_demands.csv", the original data we extracted from CATMA to work with it can be examined.

In the file "Analyses_and_Diagrams.Rmd", you can find our original code that we used to produce the plots we based our quantitative analysis on. As our quantitative analysis was
not exhaustive, there are additional plots that we did not discuss in our chapter. 

As the "Analyses_and_Diagrams.html" file is not rendered correctly on github, you can find the output at https://igrauwelman.github.io/AIPD/ with additional discussion of some of the quantitative findings (for this page to be rendered, the files "index.Rmd" and "index.html" are there as well).

# Have fun!
We hope that you enjoy reading about what we found out about the public discourse of AI in diagnostics and imaging and learn something new. If anything is unclear or you would like to know more about our project, feel free to contact us at igrauwelman@uni-osnabrueck.de!
